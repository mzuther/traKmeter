\chapter{Digital recordings}
\label{chap:digital_recordings}

The digital revolution brought a lot of advantages to the field of
audio processing such as higher fidelity, less noise and non-degrading
copies.  Unfortunately, however, digital audio also introduced some
problems of its own.

Whereas the analog domain is relatively inert against very high levels
(overdriving some analog equipment actually sounds pretty good), the
digital domain punishes even small transgressions into forbidden
territory with harsh clipping.

And while digital audio can be transferred without loss in quality, it
is degraded by each and every calculation, be it a simple change in
level, equalisation or a fancy effect.  Crossing domains from analog
to digital and \emph{vice versa} leads to additional degradation.
Finally, changes in bit depth and sample rate, jitter and inter-sample
peaks are nothing for the weak of heart.

However, most of these obstacles can be overcome easily by proper gain
staging, minimising the crossing of domains and choosing appropriate
bit depth and sample rates.  If you also learn how to properly test
and operate your equipment, you're well on your way to pure audio
bliss \dots

\section{Gain staging}
\label{sec:gain_staging}

Professional analog audio equipment is designed to be run at a nominal
level of \textbf{\SI[addsign=all]{+4}{\dBu}} (\SI{1.23}{\VRMS}) and
leaves a headroom for peaks of about \SI{20}{\dB}.  This in turn is
consistent with the maximum crest factor of analog audio signals.

Thus, driving all analog audio equipment at \SI[addsign=all]{+4}{\dBu}
ensures an optimal signal-to-noise ratio while preventing clipping and
keeping all transients intact.  The process of setting audio devices
to run at optimal input and output levels is called \emph{gain
  staging}.

Now let's transfer this to the digital domain.  As the maximum crest
factor of analog audio signals amounts to \SI{20}{\dB}, we'll adjust
the headroom accordingly by setting our average input and output
levels to \textbf{\SI{-20}{\dBFS} RMS}.

Again, this ensures a good signal-to-noise ratio while preventing
clipping.  Maybe even more important, this level also drives (most of)
your digital audio equipment and plug-ins at their respective ``sweet
spot''.

Another recommendation is that peak levels should not exceed
\textbf{\SI{-9}{\dBFS}}
(\href{http://tech.ebu.ch/publications/r068}{EBU R68-2000}) during
tracking.  This will leave enough space for inter-sample peaks, audio
peaks that lie \emph{in between} two successive samples and may lead
to unpredictable clipping during digital-to-analog conversion.

Finally, we'll emphasise the newly designated headroom and shift the
meter scales by \SI[addsign=all]{+20}{\dB}.  Thus, the optimal average
audio level is designated \textbf{\SI{0}{\dB} RMS}, while the maximum
peak audio level becomes \textbf{\SI[addsign=all]{+11}{\dB}}.  As a
nice side effect, our new scale corresponds to Bob Katz's
\textbf{\href{http://www.digido.com/level-practices-part-2-includes-the-k-system.html}{K-20
    scale}}.

\section{Digital audio myths}
\label{sec:digital_audio_myths}

I can almost hear you: you have heard that digital recordings should
be performed at peak levels close to but not exceeding \SI{0}{\dBFS}
(``digital full-scale'').  Heck, this misinformation has ended up in
the manuals of some professional audio equipment.  But for the reasons
given above it is plain wrong.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0pt}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.24,clip]{include/images/level_meter_otari.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Let's look at a worst-case scenario: even if your recordings
\emph{peak} at \SI{-20}{\dBFS} and you discard the least significant
bit (some people claim that it mostly consists of errors), a bit depth
of 16 bit would still leave you with a signal-to-noise ratio of
\SI{70}{\dB}.  That is about what you can expect from some of the best
professional analog tape machines and recording desks -- and we're not
even talking of 24 bit.

If you don't believe me yet, take a look at my professional 16-bit
hard disk recorder (Otari PD-80): its analog inputs and outputs are
aligned to ``\SI[addsign=all]{+4}{\dBu} (\textbf{\SI{-15}{\dB}} from
digital full-scale)''.  The manufacturer has even marked this level on
the meter bridge (small triangle on the photo).  Although I admit that
the mark is only useful for audio alignment, given that it sits on a
peak meter \dots

There is also a great thread over at Gearslutz (``The Reason Most ITB
mixes don’t Sound as good as Analog mixes'') well worth reading.  Here
are links to the
\href{http://www.gearslutz.com/board/5062929-post1.html}{first post}
and two other selected posts
(\href{http://www.gearslutz.com/board/5064831-post1874.html}{\#1874}
and
\href{http://www.gearslutz.com/board/5609740-post3614.html}{\#3614}).

\section{Introducing traKmeter}
\label{sec:introducing_trakmeter}

Most digital audio equipment sadly only has peak meters.  This is
readily understandable as you want to avoid digital clippings by all
means.  However, the lack of average meters makes correct gain staging
almost impossible.

For gain staging, you need average meters or -- even better -- a
combination of peak and average meters.  And this is were
\textbf{traKmeter} comes in.

\chapter{traKmeter}
\label{chap:trakmeter}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.18\linewidth}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.625,clip]{include/images/level_meter_complete.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{traKmeter} consists of two meters, a peak meter on top and an
average meter below.  The meters are separated by a blue signal LED
and consist of an area of green LEDs that is enclosed by first yellow
and then red LEDs.

You may have noticed that the average meter's green area is centred
around the \textbf{\SI{0}{\dB} RMS} mark.  This number should be
vaguely familiar.  Remember, it corresponds to \SI{-20}{\dBFS} RMS,
the level we have determined to be the optimal average audio level in
the digital domain.

A fully lit yellow LED on the peak meter's top end corresponds to a
level of \textbf{\SI[addsign=all]{+11}{\dB}} (or \SI{-9}{\dBFS}).
Again, this number should be familiar: peak levels in the digital
domain shouldn't exceed this level.

Thus, by keeping the meter's readout in the green areas and from
entering the yellow and red areas on top of each meter, you will
automatically track at optimal audio levels.

\section{Tracking with traKmeter}
\label{sec:tracking_with_trakmeter}

Open up an instance of \textbf{traKmeter} and set it up so that it
measures your audio input.  That can be done either by starting the
standalone version and connecting it to one or more input channels of
your sound card, or by inserting a plug-in instance into an input
channel of your digital audio workstation.

In the second case, take care that your digital audio workstation
doesn't add additional headroom and that no processing takes place
before \textbf{traKmeter}.  This can be ascertained by feeding
calibration tones into your sound card or by directly comparing the
readouts of standalone and plug-in version.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.42\linewidth}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.45,clip]{include/images/trakmeter_optimal.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Now, feed the signal you want to record into an audio input channel
and adjust its level (in the analog domain!) using \textbf{traKmeter}.
Try to set the input level so that transients fall into the average
meter's \textbf{\SI{0}{\dB} RMS} area.  Make sure that peak levels
never exceed \textbf{\SI[addsign=all]{+11}{\dB}}.  In case both
conditions cannot be met simultaneously, adjust the peak level only.
See the image to the right for a visual clue.

\section{Mixing with traKmeter}
\label{sec:mixing_with_trakmeter}

When you get someone else's tracks for mixing, chances are that they
have been recorded far too hot.  While you can't change that, you
might want to adjust them to optimal loudness so that your upcoming
mix is not ruined.

If the original recordings were made with poor equipment and you have
the time, it may be worth to \textbf{re-record} all tracks through a
really good preamp and adjust their loudness at the same time.
Depending on the preamp, the results can be stunning!

Another option is to insert \textbf{traKmeter} on each channel as
first plug-in, enable the ``Mixing'' button (see
\ref{sec:mixing_button}) and adjust volume using the gain knob.

In any case, mixing levels will now be much lower than what you are
used to.  This can easily be corrected by either adjusting the output
gain of your subgroups or by inserting a gain plug-in in your master
track.

To preserve all transients, the final loudness of your mix should stay
within \textbf{\SI{-20}{\dBFS} RMS} and \textbf{\SI{-16}{\dBFS} RMS}
(or between \textbf{\SI{0}{\dB} RMS} and
\textbf{\SI[addsign=all]{+4}{\dB} RMS} on the K-20 scale).  Remember
that smashed transients will be gone forever, whereas you can always
bring up the volume during mastering!  My plug-in
\href{http://code.mzuther.de/}{\textbf{K-Meter}} and its K-20 scale
may help you with setting up correct mixing levels.

\chapter{Installation}
\label{chap:installation}

In order to use the pre-compiled binaries, simply extract the
\textbf{traKmeter} files from the downloaded archive.  For the VST
plug-in, you'll then have to move the extracted files to your plug-in
folder (\path{~/.vst}, \path{C:\Program Files\Steinberg\VstPlugins\}
  or the like).

\chapter{Controls}
\label{chap:controls}

\section{Reset button}
\label{sec:reset_button}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.14\linewidth}
  \includegraphics[scale=\screenshotscale,clip]{include/images/button_reset.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Click on this button to reset all meters.  You can also use it to get
rid of graphical artifacts, because the meters will be redrawn as
well.

\section{Crest factor button}
\label{sec:crest_factor_button}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.14\linewidth}
  \includegraphics[scale=\screenshotscale,clip]{include/images/button_crest_factor_on.png}
  \newline \vspace{-0.9\baselineskip}
  \includegraphics[scale=\screenshotscale,clip]{include/images/button_crest_factor_off.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

When this button is pressed, meter readout uses the K-20 scale (crest
factor of \SI{20}{\dB}).  Disengage the button to change to decibels
relative to digital full-scale (crest factor of \SI{0}{\dB}).

\emph{Please note that although this meter uses the K-20 scale, it is
  by no means a K-System meter.}

\newpage %% layout

\section{Transient button}
\label{sec:transient_button}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.14\linewidth}
  \includegraphics[scale=\screenshotscale,clip]{include/images/button_transient_on.png}
  \newline \vspace{-0.9\baselineskip}
  \includegraphics[scale=\screenshotscale,clip]{include/images/button_transient_off.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

This button changes the RMS meter's ballistics from ``transient'' mode
to ``classic'' mode.

I find that ``transient'' mode with its fast attack and slow release
times is well suited to setting up levels.  It works fine for both
transient audio sources (drums, percussion, piano) and more ``static''
ones (pads, bass and so on).

If you are used to VU meters, however, ``classic'' mode with its
equally slow attack and release times may feel more comfortable to
you.

\emph{\underline{Note:} I don't use ``classic'' mode myself, so you
  may find that the RMS meter scale needs adjusting.  Please don't
  hesitate to notify me, it's really easy to change this.}

\section{Mixing button}
\label{sec:mixing_button}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.14\linewidth}
  \includegraphics[scale=\screenshotscale,clip]{include/images/button_mixing_on.png}
  \newline \vspace{-0.9\baselineskip}
  \includegraphics[scale=\screenshotscale,clip]{include/images/button_mixing_off.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

You can use \textbf{traKmeter} as a gain plug-in -- just enable this
button and adjust the gain knob.

When the plug-in is closed, its meters aren't updated, so it uses less
system resources.  On slow computers, however, use \textbf{traKmeter}
to find the correct gain and then exchange it against a simple gain
plug-in.

Please keep in mind that this setting should only be used for
\textbf{pre-recorded material}.  The gain stage sits \emph{before} the
meter and thus affects the meter's read-out.  So if you apply a
negative gain during recording, your analog input stage might clip
without the meters hitting the red area!

\section{Validation button}
\label{sec:validation_button}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.14\linewidth}
  \includegraphics[scale=\screenshotscale,clip]{include/images/button_validate_on.png}
  \newline \vspace{-0.9\baselineskip}
  \includegraphics[scale=\screenshotscale,clip]{include/images/button_validate_off.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Click on this button to open the \textbf{validation window} (see
\ref{chap:validation}) which allows you to play an audio file (WAV,
AIFF or FLAC) through \textbf{traKmeter} and dump internal data.
During validation, the button will light up and clicking it will stop
validation early.

\emph{Unfortunately, the underlying JUCE library does not seem to
  support multi-channel audio files.  You may load such audio files
  into your DAW of choice and insert \textbf{traKmeter} as a plug-in
  instance.}

On Linux, dumped data will be written to \path{stderr}, so just start
the \textbf{traKmeter} standalone or your VST host from the shell and
watch the output coming.  On other systems, have a look at your VST
host's log files (I have successfully used Ableton Live for this).  If
that doesn't work, you might have to start either the
\textbf{traKmeter} standalone or your VST host from a debugger.

As a side note, \textbf{SMA(50)} designates the simple moving average
of 50 values, a neat way to emphasise trends and eliminate short-term
fluctuations.

\section{About button}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.14\linewidth}
  \includegraphics[scale=\screenshotscale,clip]{include/images/button_about_on.png}
  \newline \vspace{-0.9\baselineskip}
  \includegraphics[scale=\screenshotscale,clip]{include/images/button_about_off.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Clicking on this button will open the \textbf{about window} where you
will be informed about version number, contributors, copyright and the
GNU General Public License.

\section{Display license}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.15\linewidth}
  \includegraphics[scale=\screenshotscale,clip]{include/images/button_gpl_on.png}
  \newline \vspace{-0.9\baselineskip}
  \includegraphics[scale=\screenshotscale,clip]{include/images/button_gpl_off.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

This button is located in the \textbf{about window} and does not only
advertise that you are using free software licensed under the
\textbf{GNU General Public License} -- when clicked, it will also open
the license's website in your web browser \dots

\chapter{Meters}
\label{chap:meters}

All meters possess a completely flat frequency response.  Meter scales
can be adjusted using the ``Crest factor'' button (see
\ref{sec:crest_factor_button}).

\section{Average level meter}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.18\linewidth}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.625,clip]{include/images/level_meter_average.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

The average level meter uses an averaging period of \num{1024}
samples.  It has been calibrated according to
\href{http://www.aes.org/publications/standards/search.cfm?docID=21}{AES17-1998}
so that sine wave signals read the same on both peak and average
meters.

Peaks will be held for \SI{10}{\second} and then fall with a speed of
\SI{8.67}{\dB\per\second}.

\subsection{Transient mode}

On rising levels, it takes \SI{10}{\milli\second} for the meter to
reach \SI{99}{\percent} of the final reading.  On falling levels, the
meter switches to a linear fall time of \SI{6}{\dB\per\second}.

\subsection{Classic mode}

Similar to VU meters, it takes \SI{300}{\milli\second} for the meter
to reach \SI{99}{\percent} of the final reading.  This meter exhibits
no overshoot, however.

\section{Peak level meter}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.18\linewidth}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.625,clip]{include/images/level_meter_peak.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

The peak level meter has a rise time of one sample and a fall time of
\SI{8.67}{\dB\per\second}.  The red LED marked ``OVR'' detects levels
exceeding \SI{-9}{\dBFS} and should never light.

Peaks will be indefinitely held until the meter is reset.

\section{Signal meter}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.18\linewidth}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.625,clip]{include/images/level_meter_signal.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

The blue signal meter detects peak levels of \SI{-60}{\dBFS} and
above.  It has a rise time of one sample and falls to
\SI{99}{\percent} of the final reading in \SI{1.2}{\second}.

\chapter{Recording tips}
\label{chap:recording_tips}

Over the years, I have accumulated a couple of recording tips.  You
may not know some of them, so read ahead \dots

\begin{description}

\item[Use a good preamp.]  ``Good'' doesn't mean your preamp has to
  have a lot of channels or features.  To the contrary!  Go for a
  simple design and invest your money in professional quality instead.
  Recordings made with a good preamp make mixing much easier -- the
  tracks simply seem to fall into place.

\item[ Use the preamp's gain control.]  If necessary, crank up the
  preamp to yield the needed output level.  Do not fear the preamp's
  internal noise -- making up for low gain in later stages will likely
  result in even more noise!  Also see \ref{sec:gain_staging}.

\item[Avoid unballanced equipment.]  Run all signals on balanced lines
  with a nominal level of \SI[addsign=all]{+4}{\dBu}.  If you can't,
  use DI boxes or transformers and read the previous sentence again.

\item[Use short audio chains.]  All equipment adds noise or may
  otherwise degrade audio, so keep your audio recording chains as
  short as possible.

  For example, instead of routing your mixer between preamp and hard
  disk recorder, connect the mixer to your hard disk recorder's
  \emph{outputs}.  This simple change can lead to much better
  recordings (especially with cheap mixers) and you'll still be able
  to hear yourself and other tracks during recording.

\item[Record at lower levels.]  Record digital audio at
  \textbf{\SI{-20}{\dBFS} RMS} with peak levels not exceeding
  \textbf{\SI{-9}{\dBFS}}.  For an in-depth explanation, see
  \ref{sec:gain_staging}.

\item[Record in mono.]  Most audio sources do not contain stereo
  information that is useful in a mixing context (notable exceptions
  are audience recordings, string sections and sometimes pianos).  The
  pseudo-stereo effects of some synthesisers may even cause phasing
  issues in the mixing stage.

  Recording these sources in stereo will only waste space on your hard
  disk and make you miserable during mixing.  So why not record them
  in mono in the first place?

\item[Use high bit depths.]  Do yourself a favour and record at 24 bit
  instead of 16 bit.  The additional bits provide an incredible amount
  of extra detail and you can record at lower levels without losing
  information.  When properly dithered, changing to a lower bit depth
  even preserves quite a bit of that detail.

  Also, if you edit audio files or apply effects, calculation errors
  are inevitable.  At 24 bit, however, most of these artifacts are
  \SI{48}{\dB} lower in level (and thus inaudible) compared to 16 bit
  audio files.

  Your digital audio workstation's bus should use at least 32 bits
  (floating point) to avoid accumulation of the above-mentioned
  artifacts.

\item[Avoid sample rate conversion.]  Sample rate conversion usually
  degrades audio (especially small changes of a few \si{\kilo\hertz}),
  so try to record at the target sample rate.  For instance, tracking
  for a CD release should be carried out at \SI{44.1}{\kilo\hertz}
  instead of \SI{48}{\kilo\hertz}.

  There are of course exceptions to the rule, for instance you may
  prefer to track on a professional DAT machine (\SI{48}{\kilo\hertz})
  when your only other choice is using a consumer audio interface.

  For tracking at higher sample rates, it pays to use exact multiples
  of your target sample rate (such as \SI{88.2}{\kilo\hertz} instead
  of \SI{96}{\kilo\hertz}) if your hardware and software permit.
  Please note that some professionals actually advise against using
  higher sample rates due to the possible build-up of noise beyond
  \SI{20}{\kilo\hertz}.  It is also much more demanding on your
  computer, audio equipment and plug-ins -- and may not be worth the
  hassle.  Try changing from recording at 16 bit to 24 bit first.

  Finally, only use professional software for sample rate conversion.
  This is by no means a trivial task.

\item[Concentrate on recording.]  When tracking, try to not interfere
  with the flow of the session.  This is easily done by keeping
  editing and mixing to the bare minimum.

  For example, I currently track using an old hard disk recorder, as
  digital audio workstations tend to distract me too much.

\item[Avoid copy'n'paste.]  Quite a lot of today's electronic music
  sounds like (and actually is) one short loop that was ``arranged''
  by occasionally muting some of its tracks.  This takes away all the
  small inaccuracies that happen when humans play instruments.

  Instead of looping a track eight times, record a couple of takes and
  comp the best ones.  You'll be surprised at the difference it makes!

\item[Do not fix things later.]  A bad recording is a bad recording is
  a bad recording.  You can't really ``fix it in the mix''.  So tools
  like Auto-Tune, extreme EQ or the edit button should be seen as a
  last resort.  It's easy to kill all of a track's vibe in the
  process.

  Instead, record a few more takes.  Treat your room (acoustically and
  in terms of positive vibe).  Experiment with microphone placement.
  Try everything you can to help the musicians perform better.  Maybe
  you even have to look for better musicians \dots

\end{description}

\chapter{Validation}
\label{chap:validation}

I have gone to great lengths to ensure that the meters read correctly.
You want to validate for yourself?  Just download and extract the
source code.  The directory \path{validation} contains instructions
and FLAC-compressed wave files.  A word of warning: these audio files
may \textbf{damage your ears} and speakers, so please watch your
monitor levels!

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.33\linewidth}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.65,clip]{include/images/dialog_validation.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

After opening the \textbf{validation window} (see
\ref{sec:validation_button}), click on the ellipsis button (the one
with the dots) to select an audio file for playback through
\textbf{traKmeter}.  Please make sure that the sample rates of your
host (\textbf{Host SR}) and the audio file match, otherwise the
results will not be correct.

Now, select which \textbf{variables} (if any) should be dumped.  You
may also restrict dumped data to a specific audio \textbf{channel}.
Check \textbf{CSV} if you want to feed the output to a parser.

Finally, click on the \textbf{validate} button to reset all meters and
start playback of the selected audio file.  All audio input will be
discarded during playback and for an additional ten seconds.  To stop
playback early, simply click on the \textbf{validate} button again.

\chapter{Help needed}
\label{chap:help_needed}

As \textbf{traKmeter} was coded using cross-platform code, it should
be easy to compile versions for Windows (\num{64} bit) and Mac OS X.
I just don’t have the adequate systems and compilers.

In case you want to help, please see the next chapter for an email
address.  You’ll need sufficient experience in coding, compiling and
debugging, though, so no beginners please!

\chapter{Final words}
\label{chap:final_words}

I want to thank \textbf{Rickard} of Interfearing Sounds for asking me
how to use K-Meter for tracking.  This question and the following
thoughts really got \textbf{traKmeter} started.  I'd like to thank
\textbf{bram@smartelectronix} for his code to calculate logarithmic
rise and fall times.  I must also thank the \textbf{beta testers} and
\textbf{users of traKmeter} for sending kind words, suggestions and
bug reports.  Finally, I want to thank the \textbf{open source
  community} for making all of this possible.

Although coding \textbf{traKmeter} has been a lot of fun, it has also
been a lot of work.  So if you like \textbf{traKmeter}, why not send
me a short email and tell me so?  Write a few words about yourself,
send suggestions for future updates or volunteer to create a nice
theme -- do whatever you like!

Here is my email address (please remove ``\texttt{-nospam}''):

\begin{center}
  \texttt{"Martin Zuther" <code-nospam@mzuther.de>}
\end{center}

Thanks for using free software.  I hope you'll enjoy it!

\chapter{How to build traKmeter}
\label{chap:build_trakmeter}

\section{Preparing GNU/Linux}

To build \textbf{traKmeter} yourself, I recommend setting up a
\texttt{chroot} environment.  This is fast and easy to do on
Debian-based systems and might save you a \textbf{lot} of trouble.  At
the time of writing, I'm using Linux Mint 13 (Maya), but the procedure
should be similar on your distribution of choice.  If you aim at
generic \num{64}-bit compilation, simply change \texttt{i386} to
\texttt{amd64}.

To install the necessary packages and install the \texttt{chroot} base
system, execute the following statements (please change
\path{http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/} to a
\href{http://www.debian.org/mirror/list}{mirror} close to you):

\begin{verbatim}
  sudo apt-get install debootstrap schroot

  sudo mkdir -p /srv/chroot/squeeze_i386
  sudo debootstrap --variant=buildd \
    --arch i386 squeeze \
    /srv/chroot/squeeze_i386 \
    http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/
\end{verbatim}

Running \path{debootstrap} will take some time.  Meanwhile, add the
following lines to \path{/etc/schroot/schroot.conf} (make sure you
remove all preceding white space so that each line begins in the first
column):

\begin{verbatim}
  [squeeze-i386]
  description=Debian 6 (Squeeze, i386)
  directory=/srv/chroot/squeeze_i386
  personality=linux
  root-users=username
  type=directory
  users=username,another_user
\end{verbatim}

Please make the necessary changes to \texttt{username}.  You may also
add additional users, like \texttt{another\_user}.  In case you are
setting up a \num{32}-bit \texttt{chroot} environment on a
\num{64}-bit system, you'll also have to change \texttt{linux} to
\texttt{linux32}.

When \path{debootstrap} is done, log in as superuser:

\begin{verbatim}
  schroot -c squeeze-i386 -u root
\end{verbatim}

to install a few packages.  The packages \path{less} and \path{vim}
are optional, but might come in handy:

\begin{verbatim}
  apt-get update
  apt-get -y install bash-completion libasound2-dev \
    libjack-jackd2-dev mesa-common-dev xorg-dev
  apt-get -y install less vim
  apt-get clean
\end{verbatim}

If you like \path{bash} completion, you might also want to open the
file \path{/etc/bash.bashrc} and unquote these lines:

\begin{verbatim}
  # enable bash completion in interactive shells
  [two more lines...]
  fi
\end{verbatim}

Finally, log out and log in as normal user:

\begin{verbatim}
  schroot -c squeeze-i386
\end{verbatim}

Congratulations -- after you have installed the dependencies (see
below), you are ready to build \textbf{traKmeter}.

  ./run_premake.sh
  make config=CFG TARGET
\end{verbatim}

where \application{CFG} is one of \application{debug32},
\application{debug64}, \application{release32} and
\application{release64}, and \application{TARGET} is one of
\application{linux\_standalone\_stereo},
\application{linux\_standalone\_multi},
\application{linux\_vst\_stereo} and
\application{linux\_vst\_multi}.

The compiled binaries will end up in the directory \path{bin}.

\section{Building on Microsoft Windows}

After preparing the dependencies, change into the directory
\path{build} and execute
