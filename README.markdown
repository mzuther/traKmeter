## About

Sadly, most digital audio equipment only has peak meters.  This is
readily understandable as you want to avoid digital clippings by all
means.  However, badly chosen meter ranges and scales often render
these meters useless.  And the lack of average meters does not exactly
facilitate gain staging.

When I had realised this, I started coding traKmeter.  It has evolved
with my growing knowledge and recording experience, but the underlying
ideas haven't changed at all.

## FAQ

### traKmeter crashes when the plug-in is loaded/opened

traKmeter comes with a folder called `trakmeter`.  This folder must be
located in the same folder as the plug-in, so please copy it along and
try again!
